My brief exploratory testing lead me to these checklist and thoughts:

Area: Todos CRUD

Things to Check:
1 Create item (Basic scenario, UI-level case)
1.1 Create item with the same name (Case is not valid. There's no validation for that - nothing to check really.)
1.2 Create item with empty/not valid/malicious name (While it would be nice thing to test manually, from test automation stand point I
would expect this to be filtered on service or repository level, so either integration or unit test.)
2 Mark item complete (Basic scenario, UI-level case)
2.1 Un-mark item complete (Basic scenario, UI-level case)
3 Delete item (Basic scenario, UI-level case)
3.1 Delete item when there're multiple items with the same name (Basically what we check there is that some other field (not name) is
used for delete query generation (assuming it is stored in DB). Thus it is probably great scenario for integration or even unit test,
depending on the realisation)

Area: Filtering
4 All (Basic scenario, UI-level case)
5 Active (Basic scenario, UI-level case)
6 Completed (Basic scenario, UI-level case)

Area: Bulk action
7 Delete several completed items (Basic scenario, UI-level case)
7.1 Delete one completed item (Deleting one time or 100 items should be just slightly different sql-queries generated (assuming DB is used),
so I would rather not add this as a separate scenario)
8 Select all items (Depending on the UI implementation may be a good candidate for JS unit-test)

Area: Other
9 Valid item list shown (Nothing special. May be combined nicely with some other scenario. Pretty minor thing anyway so I would rather not
add a separate UI case for that)

To start:
You will need Apache Maven installed. From the command line execute: mvn verify
